# K3S_Optiplex_Cluster_Project
Distributed omputing systems play a massive role in today's technology industries. Since it's not always feasible to have a singular powerful machine, the ability to utilize many smaller machines and combine the processing power for containerized programs has been made possible thanks to technologies like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. 
Afer taking an applied distributed computing course while working on my master's degree in computer science, I wanted to build a distributed compute cluster for myself using affordable equipment such as micro form factor computers such as the Dell Optiplex or Lenovo ThinkCentre.
